"You cheeky monkey, you"

----------
The original idea answers a question that wasn't asked:

Q:
"How do you instantiate a random Object?"

("misheard" from:)

Q:
"How do you instantiate a Random Object?"

A:
"You invoke the constructor with random parameters."

Which is well and good until you discover some Objects
which prefer to have their instances gotten at in some other way.

Likewise, when you instantiate some data structure,
you realize that it's in a rather untouched-state...
well, that's not "random."

So we invoke some random methods while we're at it.

And before you know it,
your program is generating better popart
than people pay for.
